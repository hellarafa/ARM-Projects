# ARMSim# v1.91
ARMSim# is a Windows application that allows users to _simulate_ the execution of ARM assembly language programs on a system based on the __ARM7TDMI__ processor. It includes both, an assembler and a linker.

While I was studying at Cal State Northridge, I used this program to learn ARM assembly.

I suggest you use this program to learn how to code in Assembly. Writing code in this program vs. writing code for a real ARM CPU is slightly different as you will be using different System Calls than those found in the program. Structure is the most important thing here, as learning __how__ assembly works and __how__ to _"think"_ in assembly are the most important concepts you must master in order to code successfully in assembly.
