# ARMSim# v1.91
ARMSim# is a Windows application that allows users to simulate the execution of ARM assembly language programs on a system based on the _ARM7TDMI_ processor. It includes both, an assembler and a linker.

While I was studying at my university, I used this program to learn ARM assembly.
